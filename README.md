# MacBook_Pro_Virtual_Keyboard
Created a MacBook Virtual Keyboard using HTML & CSS
While persuing my Full Stack Web Development program, I just got curious to do something with whatever I have covered so far. 
Thus created this virtual keyboard out of curiosity using html and css.
Star if you like.. ;)
